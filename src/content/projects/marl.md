I work with Professor David Parkes's research group at Harvard University as a software engineer.
I contribute to the architecture design and implementation of a multi-agent reinforcement learning research framework.
It is based on OpenAI gym, OpenAI baselines and tensorflow.
Researchers use this framework to study mechanism design in multi-agent systems.
This research project is funded by DARPA.
