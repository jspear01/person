In a hackathon, I developed a REST API backend to enable cross site image search. Like an image on a website? You can find visually similar images with one click in your browser! I won the first prize, and filed a patent for this work. The released [Google Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shutterstock-reveal/iogibhaacmieogkdgebfbjgoofdlcmgb) has been used by more than 8000 users.
