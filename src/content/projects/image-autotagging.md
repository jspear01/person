In a hackathon, I developed an algorithm for suggesting the most relevant keywords given an image. I implemented a REST API and created a visual demo. Later, this feature was productionized and [released](https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/shutterstocks-autotagging-feature-for-mobile-makes-tagging-a-breeze). Weekly content submission increased more than 60% across iOS and Android platforms.
