**Greetings!**
I'm Ivy Li, a Machine Learning / AI engineer driven by the conviction that Artificial Intelligence should enhance human potential rather than replace it.
After earning my master's degree from Columbia University, I applied AI to diverse challenges including identity fraud detection, image recognition, search and recommendation, and complex optimization problems.
I enjoy solving hard technical challenges and enabling others to do the same.

✓ Be part of Y Combinator (Summer 2018 batch).

✓ Win a hackathon (3 times).

✓ Author a patent (granted 5 technical patents).

✓ Work with AI researchers (at Harvard).

✓ Contribute to open source (OpenCV).

✓ Start an independent consulting business.

✓ Be a mentor, help others.
