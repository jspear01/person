[arXiv Reader][1] is an iOS shortcut for automatically opening an [arXiv][2] paper as responsive web page in Safari, built on top of [arXiv Vanity][3].

arXiv Vanity is an excellent open source project to render arXiv papers as responsive web pages in the browser, it is especially useful for reading on mobile because screen real estate is limited, zooming in & out a PDF document in order to read various parts of a paper is painful.

But arXiv Vanity still requires manual copy-pasting. Often times I see an interesting paper on twitter or I see an interesting paper from [arXiv RSS feeds][4] that I subscribe, I have to long press to copy the link of the paper, open up arXiv Vanity in the browser, paste the link of the paper, click convert and wait for it to render.

I want to make this easier, so I made an iOS shortcut [arXiv Reader][1]. Simply long press on an arXiv paper link -> Shareâ€¦ -> Shortcuts -> arXiv Reader, it will automatically open a Safari tab with the paper rendered nicely.
