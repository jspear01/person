title: Perceptron
---

To me, a novice programmer, understanding the algorithm is much more
easier than writing it. This is my first homework assignment of the Data
Mining/Machine Learning course Iâ€™m taking this semester, taught by
Professor [Peter Orbanz](http://stat.columbia.edu/~porbanz/) . The
perceptron algorithm is a simple idea for linear classification. R is
really handy :)

Feel free to check out the perceptron algorithm, including both batch
perceptron and fix increment single sample perceptron, in my github repo
[machine-learning](https://github.com/ivylee/machine-learning) .
