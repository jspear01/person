title: ghost easy upgrade
---

Ghost is a really nice blogging solution. I haven't updated my blog for such a long time and I am surprised to find out how easy the upgrade process is!

1. download the latest Ghost zip bundle
2. unzip
3. cd into the unzipped directory
4. rm -rf content
5. copy config.js and content from previous version Ghost directory to here
6. npm install --production
7. npm start :)

Let's hope buster still works...
