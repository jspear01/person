TLDR: Use shirotelin color theme for VIM if you work under the sun.

Working on the beach. Checked!

I borrowed a beach chair from the hotel I'm staying at, and here I am, wearing the big hat I bought from Florence and
sun glasses, sitting under the bright sun with occasional shadows
thanks to the clouds, the waves keep rolling in front of me while I try to read and type into my editor in the terminal.

For years I've been using [Zenburn](http://kippura.org/zenburnpage/) as the color theme for VIM, and guess what, it is impossible to read under the sun,
even after turning my laptop brightness to the maximum! So I started looking for something else.

I tried the popular [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) light, its yellow is too bright on my screen.
I started browsing the light themes on https://vimcolors.com, and found [shirotelin](https://github.com/yasukotelin/shirotelin), it is perfect! I don't feel blind anymore!
